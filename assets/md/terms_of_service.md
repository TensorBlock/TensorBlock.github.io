*Last Updated: June 23rd, 2025*

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in TensorBlock (the "Service"), a platform operated by Llama Valley, Inc. (“Llama Valley,” "we," or "us"). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Llama Valley, Inc. regarding your use of our website at [https://tensorblock.co](https://tensorblock.co) (“Site”), and our related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, with the platform, the "Service").

> **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE TENSORBLOCK PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THE "TERMS").** If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.

> These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Llama Valley will be resolved by **BINDING ARBITRATION**. **YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT** to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a **NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR** and **NOT** a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review Section 16 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration”) for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Llama Valley.

## 1. TensorBlock Service Overview

The Service provides a unified interface for accessing and utilizing various third-party generative artificial intelligence models (“AI Models”). To use the Service, you need to provide your valid application programming interface (API) keys from the providers of the AI Models you intend to access. By submitting your API keys to the Service, you authorize us to securely store these keys and use them to programmatically transmit your requests to the corresponding AI Model provider. The Service, therefore, functions as an intermediary, enabling interaction with multiple AI Models through a single point of access. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify the selection of AI Models supported by the Service at any time.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are under 18 years of age, you must have your parent's permission to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that organization.

## 3. Accounts and Registration

To access and utilize the full range of features offered by the Service, you must register for a personal account. The registration process will require you to provide certain information to us or our third-party authentication provider, which may include your email address and other contact details. You represent and warrant that all information you provide is accurate, complete, and current, and you agree to maintain and promptly update your account information to keep it so. Upon registration, you will establish a password or other secure credentials. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately at [support@tensorblock.co](mailto:support@tensorblock.co) of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.

## 4. User Content and Data Handling

### 4.1 User Content and Request Forwarding

You may provide input to the Service, which may include images, data, text, and other types of work (“Input”), and receive output from third-party AI Models based on your Input (“Output”). Collectively, Input and Output are referred to as “User Content.” As our Service acts as an intermediary to forward your requests to the corresponding AI Model providers, we do not store the content of your Inputs or Outputs. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights you hold in your Input. Your rights in the Output are governed by the terms of the specific AI Model you use (“AI Model Terms”). You are responsible for reviewing the applicable AI Model Terms for any AI Model you access through the Service. If the terms of a third-party AI model conflict with these Terms, you are responsible for ensuring your compliance with all applicable terms. In the event a dispute arises from your use of a third-party AI model, you agree that Llama Valley will not be held liable.

### 4.2 Token Usage Logging

To help you monitor your usage of the Service, we log metadata associated with your requests. This metadata includes the number of tokens processed in your Inputs and Outputs but does not include the content of the User Content itself. This usage data is made available to you for your personal monitoring and is not sold or shared with any third parties.

### 4.3 Input Representations and Warranties.

You are solely responsible for your Inputs and the consequences of providing Inputs. By providing Inputs, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:

- you are the creator and owner of the Inputs, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize us to process and transmit your Inputs to the relevant third-party AI Model provider for the purpose of generating an Output; and
- your Inputs, and the use of your Inputs as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause us to violate any law or regulation.

### 4.4. Input and User Content Disclaimer.

We are not obligated to monitor, edit, or control the Inputs that you or other users provide, and we will not be responsible or liable for them. We do, however, reserve the right to screen, remove, or block any Inputs at any time and without prior notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such Input violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable or illegal. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Llama Valley with respect to the Inputs. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content. If notified by a user, content owner or AI Model that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and elect to terminate your access to the Services, in our discretion. For clarity, we do not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.

### 4.5. Location of Originating Requests.

We strive to accurately provide to the AI Models the country of your originating request when accessing the Site using APIs. However, due to limitations of currently available technology, it is not always possible to accurately represent your country of origin, and this limitation may affect your ability to use the Service. You understand and agree that we are not responsible for any incorrect location reporting to the AI Models. If you believe we have incorrectly reported the country of origin for your request, please contact us at [support@tensorblock.co](mailto:support@tensorblock.co), and we will investigate and do our best to correct it.

If you violate any provision of these Terms, your permission to use the Service will terminate automatically. We may, in our sole discretion, terminate or suspend your account or access to the Service, with reasonable prior notice, unless such termination is due to your violation of these Terms or required by law, in which case no notice may be given. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service at any time (including by limiting or removing certain features), temporarily or permanently, with reasonable notice where practical. We will have no liability whatsoever for any change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service, subject to any mandatory legal rights you may have.

## 11. Indemnity.

You are responsible for your use of the Service, and you will defend and indemnify Llama Valley and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the "Llama Valley Entities") from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to, use of, or alleged use of, the Service; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim.

## 12. Disclaimers; No Warranties

- **THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE Llama Valley ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE Llama Valley ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.**
- **NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE Llama Valley ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

- **IN NO EVENT WILL THE Llama Valley ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY Llama Valley ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.**

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.**

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and Llama Valley agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Newark, Delaware for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

## 15. General

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Llama Valley regarding your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 2, 4, and 9 through 16, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.

## 16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

### 16.1. Generally.

**IN THE INTEREST OF RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Llama Valley IN THE MOST EXPEDIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, YOU AND Llama Valley AGREE THAT EVERY DISPUTE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.** Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Llama Valley ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**

### 16.2. Exceptions.

Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

### 16.3. Arbitrator.

Any arbitration between you and Llama Valley will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Llama Valley.

### 16.4. Notice; Process.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice"). Llama Valley's address for Notice is: Llama Valley, Inc., 254 CHAPMAN RD STE 209, Newark, DE 19702, United States. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Llama Valley may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Llama Valley must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

### 16.5. Fees.

As the Service is currently provided free of charge, each party shall bear its own arbitration fees in accordance with the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Newark, Delaware, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and the party bringing the frivolous claim may be required to reimburse the other party for any fees it has paid. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

### 16.6. No Class Actions.

**YOU AND Llama Valley AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and Llama Valley agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### 16.7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.

If Llama Valley makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Llama Valley's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Llama Valley's address for Notice, in which case your account with Llama Valley will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive.

### 16.8. Enforceability.

If Section 16.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

## 17. Consent to Electronic Communications.

By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.
