# Welcome to TensorBlock Forge

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, harnessing the best models from different providers is key to building powerful applications. However, this often means navigating a maze of different APIs, managing dozens of keys, and struggling to track costs.

TensorBlock Forge streamlines this complexity. It's a universal API layer for AI models that provides a single, consistent endpoint for all your development needs.

## One API, Endless Possibilities

With Forge, you can stop writing custom code for every new model you want to try.

-   **Unify Your Integrations**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, and more through a single, OpenAI-compatible API. Swap models and providers with a single line of code.
-   **Centralize Your Credentials**: Securely store all your provider API keys in one place. Access them all by generating a single, powerful Forge API key.
-   **Gain Actionable Insights**: Monitor your usage, costs, and performance across all models and providers through a unified dashboard to make smarter decisions.

## Choose Your Path

Forge is designed to fit your workflow, whether you're a solo developer or a large enterprise.

-   **The Cloud Platform**: Get started in seconds at [forge.tensorblock.co](https://forge.tensorblock.co). We prioritize your privacy: your provider keys are securely encrypted, and we never log the content of your requests. We only use metadata to generate usage insights, so you can focus on building with peace of mind.
-   **The Open-Source Edge**: For maximum control and privacy, clone the repository and deploy Forge within your own environment. You own the data, you own the infrastructure. Find out more in our [Self-Hosting Guides](./self-hosting/installation.md).
